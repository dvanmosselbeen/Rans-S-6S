Rans S-6S

Authors: David Van Mosselbeen <david.van.mosselbeen AT gmail.com>

This aircraft is completely created by David Van Mosselbeen. Thus the 3D model, the FDM as well as the XML files.

However, like the FlightGear projects is open source, as well as their aircraft's, many other resource files where used
of the FlightGear project as inspiration as well as snippets and all to build up the final Rans S-6S aircraft. This is
thus also some sort of community work.
