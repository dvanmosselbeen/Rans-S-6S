TODO

There's really a lot of stuff left to do. But here some sort of priority list:

    * Finish exterior, interior etc 3D models.
    * UV unwrap 3D models.
    * Fix/animate the two doors.
    * Check for flap angles.
    * See for a multipanel system (classic and the glass panel)
    * See for floats and skies variant.
    * See for dual control
    * Electric system
    * Add pilot and copilot weight to the (yasim) fdm.
    * See (check with jentron) for a jsbsim fdm.
    * Once uv unwrap done, create different liveries.

Thanks to the whole FG development team for all support, their source files i
can inspect and for the license choice they used which permitted me to reuse
some parts of their work. Without the community, the Rans S-6S wouldn't be what
it is so far!
